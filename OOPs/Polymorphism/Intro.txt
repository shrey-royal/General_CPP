Polymorphism in cpp:

> Polymorphism means having many forms. In C++, polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

TYpes of Polymorphism:

1. Compile time polymorphism
2. Run time polymorphism

In compile time polymorphism, the compiler knows which function to call at compile time. It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.

In run time polymorphism, the compiler doesn't know which function to call at compile time. It is achieved by function overriding. (virtual functions)
